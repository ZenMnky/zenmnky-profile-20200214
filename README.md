💡 I've got some ideas for how I want to revamp my portfolio.  
🎨 This is where get to play with those ideas.
<br />
<br />

🤔 💭 Guiding Thoughts
- I know I want the UI to feel **polished**.     
- I'd like it to be **sincere, humble, and honest**.  
- I'd like it to be **beautiful, yet stripped-down and unpretentious**.   
- I'd like it to **tell stories** about what I've learned, what I'm learning and what I'm up to, and maybe something about where I'm going - what's the dream that motivates me?

🤔 💭 More specific thoughts & inspiration
- I'd like **a nice nav** bar that transforms into a drop down for smaller screens. Something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF6k0uZuypA)
- I like the vision of having projects displayed in **[device mockups](https://smartmockups.com/mockups/multiple-devices?filter=free)**, like what's seen in this [portfolio](https://richardscott.netlify.app/)
- I love the feel and the **stories** of [this portfolio](https://www.juliacodes.com/)

👨‍💻 The Tech     
_start simple, then add layers of complexity_

Start simply:
- I'm developing this in a **Linux** Virtual Machine.
- I'm going to focus on keeping this a front-end app, using **React.js** and **JavaScript**. 

Then add layers of complexity:
- I _may_ play around with integrating a CSS library, like **Tailwind**, but to start I'll keep it simple and use standard CSS
- I'd like to add some elements of fluidity/dynamism to the site, so I _may_ try out **[react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)** physics library
- I haven't explored **React hooks** much, so if there is a need, I _may_ do that here
